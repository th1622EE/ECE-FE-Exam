# Fundamentals of Engineering for Electrical and Computer Engineering Exam Prep

This repository was created as a study aid written entirely in Python. The purpose of creating this repository is to provide a **FREE** and open-source study tool for those studying for the FE Electrical and Computer exam, or simply for anyone wishing to clarify fundamental concepts through the use of scripts written to perform numerical analysis and visualization.

## Project Architecture

This project is broken down into a variety of relatively self explanatory folders. However, the directory containing all of the source code for the varioius knowledge areas specific to the exam are located in the [modules](modules) directory. Within this directory are all of the areas defined in the [FE Electrical and Computer Exam Specifications](docs/fundamentals_of_engineering_handbook_v10.0.1.pdf) located within the [docs](docs) directory. While the majority of the source code will be derived from this manual, the remainder will be derived from the other resources located within the [docs](docs) directory. The [data](data) directory contains all of the data files used as applicable input for the various scripts specific to the knowledge areas within the [modules](modules) directory.

## Knowledge Areas

The following is a high-level overview of the various knowledge areas (excluding the sub-topics covered under each knowledge area which can be found on page 479 of the [Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Electrical and Computer CBT Exam Specifications](docs/fundamentals_of_engineering_handbook_v10.0.1.pdf)).
